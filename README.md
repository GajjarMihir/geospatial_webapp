# Geospatial Web Application

Goal:
The goal is to create a geospatial web application which can show raster and polygon data along with some options to control the information which is being displayed on the web app for e.g. polygon transparency, select specific bands etc.

Use:
* This can be useful in the results delivery/error analysis stage of a project where one wants to deliver/analyze model predictions. The predicted polygons can be shown on the web application which can allow a user to better navigate through the raster and polygon data.
